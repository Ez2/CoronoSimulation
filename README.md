#Corona virus simulator

This is a very simple simulator, that only gives a basic idea of what we might expect from the Corona epidemic. 

It assumes the following:
- There's an upper bound to the number of infections. Here set at the Dutch population size (17 million)
- Every infected person will spread the virus to 3 other people, but only after 7, 8 and 9 days.
- after 30 days, a person recovers or deceases. 3 percent doesn't survive the effects of the virus.

The totals are calculated when the epidemic stops. This is when no new infections occur.
